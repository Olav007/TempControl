# About
This repo is for a "code assignment".  
"Specs" are not included in this README to make it less visible.

## Implementation vs specs
The cmake file is for the whole source, including test, the intention is probably that it should be for the business component/module.
Practically it makes most sence to have a everything in the header, especially if performance is important.
